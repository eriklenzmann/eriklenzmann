### Hello there 🖐️

I'm Erik Lenzmann, a passionate full-stack developer with a touch of love for backend development.

🚙 I'm currently working on [EVAPP](https://github.com/eriklenzmann/EVAPP) a React Native carpooling app for sharing journeys and splitting costs.

🎲 When I'm not lost in lines of code, you'll see me out with my friends most probably playing board games.
